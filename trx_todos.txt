I1: 16jun16 svn:
==================
Testcase 7 does not recognize trx as P2SH, addresses are displayed wrong.

I3: 30jun16 svn:
==================
trx2txt.sh: 
a.) need to properly verify unsigned raw trx - no code yet ...
b.) need to create testcases

I5: 30jun16 svn:
==================
trx_create_sign.sh: beautify code, remove unnecessary stuff, and do two things:
a.) strict DER verification in STEP 16
b.) verify that r or s is not bigger than N/2, also STEP 16
c.) prepare test cases for these addresses (STEP 11, leading zeros/chksum)

==================
trx_create_sign.sh: base58decoding: need to extract beginning "1"s and count them...
#maybe like this:  /^(1*)/
The logic is described below, at the end - need to verify...

I10: 18jul16 svn:
==================
testcaes_trx2txt.sh: testcase 9 fails on OpenBSD, cause parameter buffer is only 2048 Bytes

### Some explanations on leading zeros #
########################################

1. Convert each leading "one" to a single byte of value 0
2. Convert the remaining digits from base58 to hex
3. The result should be exactly 25 bytes long, if not you have an invalid address.
4. Make sure that the leading byte is either a value of 0 or a value of 5, if not you have an invalid address.
5. Remove the trailing 4 bytes, leaving you with a 21 byte hex value.
6. Calculate SHA256(SHA256()) on the 21 bytes.
7. Make sure the first 4 bytes of step 6 are equal to the 4 bytes removed in step 5, if not you have an invalid address.
8. If you get this far without determining that the address is invalid, then the address is valid.

(programmatically, you may find it easier to reverse the order of the first two steps)



Lets walk through the steps and see what happens:

Starting with an RIPEMD-160 hash of 20 bytes that are all 0's...
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Add a version byte in front (in the case of a P2PKH address, that would be a byte with value 0).

000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Now we have 21 bytes that are all 0's.

Calculate a checksum on this value:

Code:

SHA256(SHA256(000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)) = 
94a00911c4da27f9271727ffa7a14d8d5588fc0fff9964340ec4065f387e622b


Append the first 4 bytes (8 characters) of the checksum to the RIPEMD-160 hash with version byte:
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000094a00911

Temporarily ignore leading zero bytes:
94a00911

Convert the value from hex to base58:
0x94a00911 =
4oLvT2 (base 58)

Each LEADING 00 BYTE is replaced with a single 1:
Code:

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1


Concatenate 21 ones with 6 base58 digits:
1111111111111111111114oLvT2

21 "ones" plus 6 base58 digits = 27 characters


Now lets try the same with 19 zeros and a bytes with value 1...

0000000000000000000000000000000000000001

Add a version byte in front (in the case of a P2PKH address, that would be a byte with value 0).

000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

Now we have 20 bytes that are all 0's, followed by a byte that is represented in hex as "01"

Calculate a checksum on this value:

Code:

SHA256(SHA256(000000000000000000000000000000000000000001)) = 
9d35b5b9d5befcf2d6b89994f7f64279b0645d5d4a5f1a6fa2dcc615bbed04ef


Append the first 4 bytes (8 characters) of the checksum to the RIPEMD-160 hash with version byte:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000019d35b5b9

Temporarily ignore leading zero bytes:
019d35b5b9

Convert the value from hex to base58:
0x019d35b5b9 =
BZbvjr (base 58)

Each LEADING 00 BYTE is replaced with a single 1:
Code:

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1


Concatenate 20 ones with 6 base58 digits:
111111111111111111111BZbvjr

20 "ones" plus 6 base58 digits = 26 characters

(notice that the number of leading 0 bytes was decreased by 1 because the last byte was now a 01, however the number of base58 digits didn't increase since both 0x94a00911 and 0x019d35b5b9 can be represented with 6 base58 digits (4oLvT2 and BZbvjr respectively).
